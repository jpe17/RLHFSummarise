      "content": "Six years ago, I embarked on an unconventional path to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer. It wasn't easy, and it took longer than planned, but I never gave up. Each course brought moments of doubt, tears, and triumph - especially when I conquered subjects I initially feared.\n\nThat's the beauty of life: you step into the unknown, push through, and emerge with knowledge and strength no one can take away.\n\nI chose a rigorous program registered with the California State Bar, building on 75 college credits to complete a four-year curriculum that stretched to six. The journey was real, and so is the accomplishment.\n\nHaving Chris Young, Michelle West, and Dawn Jackson, whom my team and I championed for their release from prison, speak at my graduation meant the world to me. Their deeply personal stories of perseverance through adversity and injustice profoundly inspires me and form the heart of my \"why.\"\n\nI'm deeply grateful to Van Jones, who introduced me to this path, and to my mentors, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney, whose guidance was invaluable.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sam Farkas and Chuck Shonholtz, who dedicated countless hours to help me succeed.\n\nThis experience has shaped me profoundly, and I'll carry its lessons with me forever. Here's to celebrating resilience and new beginnings! ‚öñÔ∏èüéì",
