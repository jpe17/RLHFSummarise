    "transcription": "The Prime Minister has welcomed the German Chancellor of Theatreic Merz on his first official  visit to the UK.  They have signed a bilateral treaty, which promises to smash smuggling gangs, expand defense  exports, and create closer industrial ties between the UK and Germany.  The Prime Minister has said the treaty is the first of its kind and will strengthen the  existing partnership.  The agreement is part of Starmer's wider effort to rebuild Britain's influence in Europe.  It's a privilege to have you here today, particularly to sign this Kensington Treaty,  which is a very special treaty because it's the first of its kind ever, if you can believe  it, between our two countries.  And I see it very much as evidence of the closeness of our relationship as it stands today,  the strength of our values, the strength of our joint approach, but also very much as  a statement of intent, a statement of our ambition to work ever more closely together,  closest of allies, and whether that's on defence, security, trade, the economy, energy  covers so much in this treaty.  And so this is a really historic signing of a historic agreement.  And let's bring in our political correspondent Liz Bates for more on this, the two politicians  from opposing sides of the political spectrum, but they do have a lot of common aims, don't  they?  They certainly do, and that's what we're seeing play out today in the signing of this  treaty.  The Kensington Treaty, they really are making the most of this moment the biggest treaty  between the UK and Germany since 1945.  Unsurprising, given the global context that defence and security cooperation is at the  heart of this, and there's a bilateral meeting currently going on, and they will be discussing  more of the detail of that, an agreement today on the development of new long-range missile  system and a mutual assistance pledge as well.  And of course, all of this is in the light of the latest from President Trump on Ukraine  and the US's commitment to provide more weapons to Ukraine, so they will be again discussing  the detail of that and how that will work in terms of delivery in practice.  And of course, central to what is going on today, the Europe-wide effort to stamp out  illegal migration, and in particular, from Labour's perspective, trying to smash the  gang, so a renewed commitment today from the German Chancellor to ramp up prosy prosecution  in his country against the people's smugglers, as part of it, as I say, this EU-wide  effort, and this is all part of a resetting of the relationship between the UK and European  countries under this government, under a Labour government that came in in the wake of everything  that went on many severed ties and difficult relationships, post-Brexit, and I think this  government has seen its responsibility on the international stage to start putting those  relationships back together and start to cooperate in lots of different areas, particularly  on immigration and defence and security, and of course, especially in the light of what we  have heard over many months now, from the US President, in particular, some stepping back from  some of those NATO commitments and putting pressure on European countries to ramp up  their own defence spending. So I think you're seeing all of that play out today, and of course,  for the Prime Minister, he's got a few issues, should I say, with his party on the domestic front,  the suspension of four Labour MPs for ill-discipline, so he will welcome this moment to be a statesman  and to welcome an international partner and to make the most of that. So as I say, bilateral  meetings still going on, we'll get a read out of all the details of that and we will bring you that  as we get to this afternoon. Yeah, I'll be interesting to see what comes out of those meetings.  For the moment, Liz, thank you.",
